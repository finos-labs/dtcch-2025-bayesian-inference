# Anomaly Detection Dashboard

This project implements an anomaly detection pipeline (using KMeans clustering and adaptive thresholding) on security reference data and displays the results via a Streamlit frontend. The project is structured as follows:

- **app.py**: The main Streamlit application.
- **model/**: Contains all modules for data processing, anomaly detection, and visualization.
